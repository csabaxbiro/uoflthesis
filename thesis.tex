\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgment}

I would like to thank my major professor, Dr.~Jack Watson, for his guidance and
patience. I would also like to thank the other committee members, Dr.~Joe Perona and
Dr.~Fred Weber, for their comments and assistance over the past four years. I would also
like to express my thanks to my wife, Amy, for her understanding and patience during
those times when there was no light at the end of anything. She encouraged me and made
me stick with it. Also, many thanks to the members of my family in Savannah, Georgia:
Paul and Jeanenne Adams, Jim and Catherine Shippy, and the late Eleanor and Fred Catti.
Finally, I would like to thank the members of my family in Knoxville, Tennessee, Andy
and Ruth Thomason.
